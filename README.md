## ML Project
Given the problem at hand, where we have labeled data for all entries, we will focus on Supervised Learning Algorithms. Considering the current dataset size and its potential for scalability, we have selected three types of models across varying levels of complexity:

	•	Simple Model: Logistic Regression
	•	Ensemble Model: Random Forest
	•	Complex Model: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Since the target variable shows a class imbalance, two strategies will be applied to address this:

	•	Undersampling: Reducing the majority class to balance with the minority class.
	•	Oversampling: Increasing the minority class instances to match the majority class.

These techniques will be applied to ensure more balanced learning across models and to enhance their performance in predicting the minority class.
